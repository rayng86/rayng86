### Hi there, my name is Raymond. ðŸ‘‹

I'm frontend engineer with a passion for building beautiful UI/UX experiences. I love building things and working alongside an awesome group of people. I'm passionate about building apps for web and mobile that make a positive impact on the lives of people. Aside from coding, I also enjoy biking, hiking and hanging out with my dog.
